# Quality-Control-Hot-Rolled-Steel-Strips
This project aims to automatically detect surface defects in Hot-Rolled Steel Strips such as rolled-in scale, patches, crazing, pitted surface, inclusion and scratches. A CNN is trained on the NEU Metal Surface Defects Database which contains 1800 grayscale images with 300 samples of each of the six different kinds of surface defects.
